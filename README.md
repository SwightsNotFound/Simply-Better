## A modpack thats designed to make Minecraft _**Simply Better**_.

The goal of Simply Better is to strike a balance between enhanced visuals and performance, all while adding a variety of quality-of-life features. If you're looking for a modpack that focuses purely on performance, consider installing [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) instead.

An example showcasing what the pack looks like at nighttime, including item animations, the hotbar, and a glimpse of the chat interface.

## **Disclaimers/Notes**
- **If you have 16GB of RAM or more, I recommend setting the Maximum memory allocation to at least 8GB.**
- This modpack is mainly made for me and some friends, so updates only happen when we need them. Nonetheless, you're welcome to use it, and I would appreciate it if you reported any issues you have to GitHub.
- While you can use this modpack on online servers, it's not entirely made for that purpose. Some of the mods included (like [Freecam](https://modrinth.com/mod/freecam) for example) could get you flagged if used, but it's more likely they simply wouldn't work.
- Make sure to tune the default keybinds and settings to your liking.
